# DS1 Final Project

This is where I will be storing my files for my Data Science I: Foundations final project. I will be using the U.S. Energy Information Administration's Form 861 to look at the relationship between grid reliability and various grid metrics such as net metering, distributed generation, energy efficiency, and demand response. Methods employed include: Random Forest, KNN, Linear Regression, and Decision Trees.
